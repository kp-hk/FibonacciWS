# FibonacciWS
Web Service for Calculating Fibonacci Numbers

1. This project provides a RESTful web service.

  a. It accepts a number, n, as input and returns the first n Fibonacci numbers, starting from 0. I.e. given n  = 5, it outputs the sequence [0, 1, 1, 2, 3].

  b. Given a negative number, it responds with an error.

2. It includes instructions to build and deploy the software. When run, it accepts requests and responding to them as appropriate.

3. It includes functional and unit tests.

4. It is written with the Go language.

5. Docker containerized at https://hub.docker.com/r/kkphk/fibonacci/
